### Project Takeaway

My main goals on working this project is not only to fill the requirements but also learn something new. I initially deciding to use meta-framework like next or remix. But with recent development of react team deprecating create-next-app, I want to look once again into the more client centerd fetching framework so I decided to use vite for this app. I'm also using react-router-dom and it's loading and action function. At a first glance it look like something that can help client rendered app with problems like FTTB and page flasing on redirect. So i decided to give it a try on this project in favor of the more well rounded approach of using apollo react's hook for fetching.
