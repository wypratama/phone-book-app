### Project Takeaway

My primary objective in working on this project is not only to fulfill the requirements, but also to learn and expand my skills. Initially, I had considered using a meta-framework such as Next or Remix. However, due to the recent development of the React team deprecating create-next-app, I decided to re-evaluate and explore more client-centered fetching frameworks. After careful consideration, I opted to use Vite for this app, along with React Router DOM and its loading and action function.

Upon closer inspection, I believe that this approach can help address common client-rendered app issues, such as FTTB and page flashing on redirect. While I acknowledge the benefits of using Apollo React's hook for fetching, I felt that, for a simple project like this one, where there are not many static assets to load and not much external data to call, the difference would be difficult to notice.

Overall, I recognize that there is still much room for improvement in this project, and I welcome any feedback or input that can help me enhance my skills and knowledge.
